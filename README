Lasercut Yinsh Board README

This is asymptote code, and the generated .pdf, for a lasercut Yinsh board.
Yinsh is a great two player abstract strategy game by Kris Burm.  I am NOT
affiliated in any way with Kris Burm; Yinsh is just my favorite board game, and
I wanted to pimp my Yinsh set with a more durable playing board.  The YINSH
pieces in the official set are extremely well made and feel great in your
hands.  I recommend you purchase an official boxed set for the pieces even if
you lasercut your own board.  

Thanks,
Drew Wagner
